# Project_Motion_Alert_System_for_Assistive_Safety
The solution implements a real-time motion detection and alert system using the FRDM-K66F development board with integrated FXOS8700CQ accelerometer. The system monitors tilt orientation, triggering alerts through RGB LED indicators and an external buzzer.
